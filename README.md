# Game of War
This is an example of how to build the "game" of war with a Jersey API and MongoDB db.
 This API is could be consumed by a UI. This app can be expanded to host other 
 simple card games as well. I used the following:
- Jersey _2_
- Spring _4_
- mongo-java-driver _2_
- spring-data-mongodb _1.2_

In this project I also tested with difference frameworks
- junit _4.10_
- JMockit _1.24_
- hamcrest _1.3_
